<H1>Customer Satisfaction Survey</H1> <!-- I chose to do a customer satisfaction survey because they are used often and are relevant  -->
	
	<!-- Possible questions: 
		1. What did you buy?
		2. How many items did you buy?
		3. What was the total cost of your purchase (subtotal whole integer)?
		4. Verify if the cost is accurate?
		5. Do you think that this is a fair price?
		6. Do you have any feedback for us?
		7. Are you satisfied with the service?
		8. How likely are you to recommend us to family or friends?
		9. Do you think that we are taking enough cautions to ensure your safety during these times?
		10. What more could we do? -->
